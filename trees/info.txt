UNLABLED nodes
=======================
no. of tree combination with given no. of nodes(catalan no.)[t(n)] = (2n^Cn)/(n+1)
height start from 0
level start from 1
no. of trees with max height=2^(n-1)
alternate catalan no. = sum(t(i-1)*t(n-i)) , where i starting from 1

LABLED nodes
=======================
catalan no.= t(n)=(2n^Cn) * n!/(n+1)  , n! is due to they can arrange in n! ways.
