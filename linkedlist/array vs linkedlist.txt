insertion and deletion 
=============================
both are same in array and linkedlist
from right side -> O(1)
from left side -> O(n)
from left side LinkedList is slightly better because it modify links only,but in array movement of elements is done.

Space
================
Linked list takes more Space

Searching
=================
Array : linearSearch, BinarySearch
LinkedList: linearSearch
if we implement BinarySearch in LinkedList ,it will take O(nlogn) time

NOTE - insertionSort and MergeSort is designed(more friendly) for linkedlist
